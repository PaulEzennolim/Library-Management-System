# Library Management System

Welcome to the Library Management System project! This application is designed to streamline library operations, including book inventory management, staff management, and administrative tasks. Developed using Java with the NetBeans IDE and MySQL, it provides a user-friendly interface and efficient backend database management.

Project Overview

Front End

The front end of the application is built using Java Swing, featuring several JFrames:

* Login Page: The initial interface where the admin logs in.

* Dashboard: Post-login, the admin can access various functionalities:

- View Available Books: Display a list of all books in the library.

- View Staff Details: Display a list of all staff members.

- Add/Remove Books: Manage the library's book inventory.

- Add/Remove Staff: Manage staff member information.

Back End

The back end is powered by MySQL and comprises three main tables:

* Admin Table: Stores admin credentials and login information.

* Books Table: Maintains a record of all books, including details like title, author, ISBN, and availability.

* Staff Table: Contains information about the library staff members, including their roles and contact details.

The application uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to integrate the front end with the back end, enabling seamless data transactions and management.

Technologies Used:

* Java: Core programming language used for developing the front end and application logic.

* Java Swing: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

* NetBeans IDE: Integrated Development Environment for Java development.

* MySQL: Database management system for storing and managing data.

* JDBC: API for connecting and executing SQL queries in the database.

Features:

* Secure Login: Ensures that only authorized personnel can access the system.

* Book Management: Add, remove, or view details of books in the library.

* Staff Management: Add, remove, or view details of staff members.

* User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-navigate GUI for smooth user experience.
